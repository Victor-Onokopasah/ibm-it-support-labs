# ibm-it-support-labs
A collection of hands-on labs and projects from my IBM IT Support Certification journey. Showcasing troubleshooting, networking, system administration, and help desk skills for entry-level IT support roles.

Safety Gear

To ensure proper handling of computer hardware and prevent damage from electrostatic discharge (ESD), the following safety equipment was used during this lab:

-Anti‑Static Wrist Strap – Worn on the wrist and clipped to a grounded metal part of the PC case to safely dissipate static electricity before touching internal components. This prevents accidental ESD that could damage sensitive parts such as the CPU, RAM, and motherboard.

-ESD‑Safe Gloves – Lightweight, conductive‑fiber gloves worn when handling delicate components to avoid transferring skin oils or fingerprints to contacts and circuitry. These gloves also provide an additional layer of static protection while maintaining dexterity.

Rationale:  
Using both an anti‑static wrist strap and ESD‑safe gloves demonstrates adherence to industry‑standard safety protocols. This not only protects the hardware but also reflects professional practice expected in IT support and repair environments.
